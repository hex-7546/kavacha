# FPGA Bring-up

Kavacha ships a self-contained, board-independent FPGA SoC (`fpga/kavacha_fpga.sv`)
for real-hardware bring-up, along with constraint templates for the Digilent
Arty A7 and the Xilinx ZCU102.

## FPGA SoC

The synthesizable SoC bundles everything needed to see the core run on a board:

| Component | Address | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Unified RAM (code + data + stack) | `0x0000_0000` | distributed LUT-RAM, `$readmemh`-initialised from a firmware image |
| CLINT (msip / mtime / mtimecmp) | `0x0200_0000` | machine timer and software interrupt |
| UART | `0x1000_0000` | synthesizable 115200-8N1 console |
| `tohost` | `0x2000_0000` | simulation / bring-up handshake |
| LED register | `0x2000_1000` | low 8 bits drive user LEDs |
| Debug Module + JTAG DTM | — | attach OpenOCD for on-target debug |

The design is board-agnostic: give it **one clock and one reset** and it runs.
Board tops adapt pins, clocking, and I/O.

## Firmware image

The RAM is initialised from a `firmware.mem` image (`$readmemh` format, one
32-bit word per line). A prebuilt image is included; to rebuild it from the
bring-up assembly demo you need a RISC-V toolchain:

```bash
cd sw
bash build_fpga_hello.sh      # produces firmware.mem
```

## Simulating the SoC

```bash
./build.sh fpga
```

This elaborates the full SoC with the UART and Debug Module and runs it,
printing the firmware's UART banner and exercising the LED activity — a quick
confidence check before synthesis.

## Digilent Arty A7

`fpga/arty_a7/` targets the Arty A7-100T (`xc7a100tcsg324-1`) and runs the SoC
directly from the board's 100 MHz oscillator.

| Signal | Pin | Function |
|--------|-----|----------|
| `CLK100` | E3 | 100 MHz oscillator |
| `ck_rst` | C2 | reset push-button (active-low) |
| `led[3:0]` | H5 J5 T9 T10 | firmware activity pattern |
| `uart_txd_in` | A9 | host → FPGA (RX) |
| `uart_rxd_out` | D10 | FPGA → host (TX), 115200-8N1 |
| `jtag_*` | PMOD JA | RISC-V debug (attach OpenOCD) |

The provided `.xdc` constraints and `.tcl` build script drive a Vivado
project; supply `firmware.mem` to the project as described in the header.

## Xilinx ZCU102

`fpga/zcu102/` targets the ZCU102 (`xczu9eg-ffvb1156-2-e`) PL. It is a
**template**: the ZCU102 PL has no fixed single-ended oscillator and its
USB-UART is wired to the PS, so you must finalise the clock source (a Clocking
Wizard output or `pl_clk0`) and route the UART to a PMOD for a PL-only console.
Verify all pins against your board revision and the board master XDC before
building.

!!! note
    The FPGA tops are starting points. Always confirm device part, pin
    assignments, and clocking against your specific board revision.
